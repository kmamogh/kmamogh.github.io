						<p> 
							I am a nano-electronic device design research enthusiast from India, and an incoming master's student at
							Duke University. After having extensively worked on Graphene-based FETs and GaN circuit-level reliability
							problems for over four years, I have developed a unique appreciation of device-physics, process integration, 
							nanofabrication, different material and electrical characterization techniques, and also certain aspects of 
							device co-design for specific circuit integration objectives. I hope to utilize this expertise and 
							background to design and develop devices for novel computing paradigms in the times to come. <br><br>
							While I have worked only on charge transport-devices in the past, I am also deeply interigued by
							other types of devices - including solid-state qubits, spin-based devices, and photonic devices. Given 
							my experience with RF characterization (S-parameter measurements) using advanced VNAs and other crucial skills,
							I believe I am well	positioned to collaborate on problems in these domains, too.<br><br>
							During my time working on Graphene-based devices, I have developed a deep interest in 2D materials such as 
							Graphene, TMDs and h-BN, and their unique quantum properties. Ideally, I would like to work on design, 
							computations & simulation, fabrication & characterization and modelling of quantum devices that are based 
							on these 2D materials. <br>
